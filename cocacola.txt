Coca Cola tastes good and is caffeinated 
which energizes me. Sometimes, if I dont
 want to work I bribe myself with a big
gulp. My favorite is a Slurpee though
particularly if it is from Speedway. 
I don't like pepsi or other sodas though.
Sprite reminds me too much of having an upset
stomach as a kid. I really ought to quit
 soda and I have tried several times to now 
avail.
